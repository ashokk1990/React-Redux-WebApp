This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Development Configuration
Clone the repository and do things below:
* run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
* run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start a development server on port 3000.

For UI, I'm using [Ant Design](https://ant.design) components and applied some inline CSS for styling.
